## Proper Usage

Java isn't really a programming language that's intended for easy usage.  They try to stay away from reading OS environment variables, for instance, because it makes the system 'dependant on the platform'.  If you're a really big fan of platforms, this news might bum you out, but the ideal solution in the java world is to use `properties`.


```
$  java -Dlaunchtime_property=pewpew -jar target/test-app-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
